# SwellFinder

A mobile Surfline-type clone for tracking surf.

## Access Instructions

Due to default publication settings on Expo, access is currently limited to my personal Expo account alone. In order to use the app:

### 1. Open the Expo Go app.

If you haven't already, download the Expo Go app from your respective app store. Open the app once downloaded.

### 2. Login using my credentials.

In order to use the SwellFinder application, you must login using my personal Expo account credentials:

Username: grantgroseclose

Password: Ama$yganalda421

### 3. Open the SwellFinder app.

The SwellFinder app can be found under 'Projects'.

### 4. Register/Login.

In terms of the SwellFinder application itself, you can register your own account which will redirect you back to the start screen. You can then login using your newly created user credentials. 

Alternatively, you can use my own SwellFinder account (created for testing, development, and, yes, personal use :)):
